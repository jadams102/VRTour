# VR Tour

VR Tour app for Gear VR and Google Cardboard

#### By **Joel Adams**

## Description


This app is a scalable virtual reality tour for Google Cardboard and Gear VR. The app allows a user to navigate through spheres with equirectangular 360 images mapped to the inside of the sphere. Each sphere contains four navigational buttons, for north, south, east, and west; these buttons move the user between spheres and only display in-app if they are assigned a landing sphere. To maximize compatibility with VR platforms the app uses a gaze based pointer system from the Google Cardboard SDK.
